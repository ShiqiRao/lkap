# Test Note 3

This is a third test note that contains links and demonstrates backlinks.

## Demonstration of Backlinks

This note is linked from both Test Note 1 and Test Note 2, so it should show those as backlinks in the Backlinks view.

## Links to Other Notes

- Back to [[test-note-1]]
- Different syntax link: [Note 2](test-note-2.md)

## Important Points

1. Backlinks should be visible in the sidebar
2. Clicking on a link should navigate to the target note
3. Hovering over a link should show a preview
4. Missing links should be created when clicked (if configured)
